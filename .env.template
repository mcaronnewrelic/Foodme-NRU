# New Relic Configuration - these are used by the APM agent to connect to New Relic
# This file is used to set environment variables for New Relic in the Docker container
# Copy this file to .env.local and fill in your actual values
# Example usage:
# 1. Copy this file: cp .env.example .env
# 2. Edit .env with your actual values
NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME="FoodMe"
NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY="your-new-relic-license-key-here"

# Note: These secrets are used to create a change marker in New Relic
# They are not required for the APM agent to function, but are useful for tracking deployments
# You can create these in New Relic One under your user profile -> API Keys
# The API Key is used to authenticate the deployment marker API call
# The Entity GUID is used to uniquely identify the application entity in New Relic
# These values are not sensitive and can be safely shared in the codebase
# The Entity GUID can be found in the application metadata in New Relic One
NEW_RELIC_API_KEY="your-new-relic-api-key-here"
ENTITY_GUID="your-new-relic-entity-guid-here"
# To create a New Relic API Key:
# 1. Go to New Relic One
# 2. Click on your user profile
# 3. Go to API Keys
# 4. Create a new User API key (not License key)

# Note: Replace the placeholder values above with your actual New Relic credentials
# To use these environment variables in your Docker container, you can either:
# 1. Use a .env file and pass it to Docker with --env-file .env
# 2. Set them directly in your Dockerfile or docker-compose.yml file
# 3. Use Docker secrets for sensitive values (recommended for production)
