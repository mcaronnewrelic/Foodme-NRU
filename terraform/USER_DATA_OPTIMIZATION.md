# User Data Script Optimization Summary

## Problem
The original `user_data.sh` script was ~14.5KB and approaching the AWS EC2 user data limit of 16KB, causing Terraform plan failures with the error:
```
Error: expected length of user_data to be in the range (0 - 16384)
```

## Solution
Created a minimal user data script that reduces the size from ~14.5KB to ~3.5KB (75% reduction) while maintaining all essential functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. Streamlined Package Installation
- Combined package installation commands
- Removed verbose comments and formatting
- Used more efficient dnf install syntax

### 2. Simplified Configuration Files
- Reduced nginx configuration to essential directives only
- Minimized systemd service configuration
- Compressed CloudWatch agent configuration (removed unnecessary metrics)

### 3. Optimized Placeholder Application
- Simplified Node.js server to essential endpoints only
- Inline CSS instead of separate files
- Removed verbose logging and error handling from placeholder

### 4. Compact Shell Scripts
- Reduced health check script from ~40 lines to ~10 lines
- Simplified deployment script logic
- Removed verbose output and debugging statements

### 5. Efficient Here Documents
- Minified JSON configurations
- Removed unnecessary whitespace and comments
- Combined related operations

## Files Created

### Production Files
- `user_data.sh` - New minimal version (3.5KB)
- `user_data_original.sh` - Backup of original script

### Alternative Approaches (for reference)
- `user_data_streamlined.sh` - External config approach (2.5KB)
- `user_data_minimal.sh` - Source for the minimal version
- `configs/` - Directory with individual config files for external approach

## Key Features Preserved
✅ Nginx reverse proxy configuration
✅ Systemd service setup  
✅ Health check endpoint (`/health`)
✅ API endpoints (`/api/restaurant`, `/api/health`)
✅ CloudWatch agent configuration
✅ Deployment scripts
✅ Security headers and SSL-ready configuration
✅ Log rotation and monitoring

## What Was Simplified
- Reduced verbose logging and debug output
- Simplified error handling in placeholder app
- Minimized CloudWatch metrics (kept essential CPU/memory)
- Removed extensive comments and documentation
- Compressed configuration files

## Usage
The new script maintains full compatibility with your existing Terraform configuration and GitHub Actions deployment process. No changes needed to your deployment workflow.

## Size Comparison
- Original: ~14.5KB (approaching 16KB limit)
- New: ~3.5KB (78% smaller, plenty of room for future additions)

## Testing
The script has been validated with:
- ✅ Terraform validate
- ✅ Health check endpoints functional
- ✅ All essential services configured
- ✅ CloudWatch monitoring enabled
